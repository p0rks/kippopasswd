This is a bash and python script to strip out passwords from Kippo log files.

Prep:
	First we need to make the scripts executable by the command shell.
	Type:
		chmod +x getpasswds.sh
		chmod +x readlog

	This adds the Execute flag to the file

To run just type: ./getpasswds.sh
	This will output the stripped passwords to the screen.
	To get them into their own file type this:
		./getpasswds.sh > CHINA_PASSWORDS

	Then you can view CHINA_PASSWORDS as a text file. ;D

To get these files on your system:
	git clone https://github.com/p0rks/kippopasswd
	cd kippopasswd
	
Options:
	Change kippo log file location in getpasswds.sh before running.

--p0rks.
